# Laptop Price Predictor

Welcome to the **Laptop Price Predictor** â€” your handy companion to estimate the price of a laptop based on its features. Whether youâ€™re a buyer trying to spot a good deal or a seller wanting to price your machine fairly, this project aims to make the guessing game a lot easier and data-driven!

## What This Project Does

Using a dataset of laptops and their specifications, this project builds a machine learning model that learns the relationship between hardware features (like RAM, screen size, CPU, storage) and their market prices.  
Once trained, the model can predict the estimated price of a laptop given its specs. This prediction helps you understand if a laptop is priced too low, too high, or just right.

## Key Features

- Predict laptop price based on popular features like brand, RAM, storage, screen size, and more.
- Interactive web app built with Streamlit for easy user input and instant price estimation.
- Clean data preprocessing and feature engineering for accurate modeling.
- Model powered by Random Forest Regressor, a strong and reliable machine learning algorithm.
- Label encoding for categorical variables to make machine learning friendly.
- Intuitive UI with a sidebar for specs input and instant display of predicted price.
